NEEDS INFO
To use these skins with skinr you need to have skinr and skinr_ui installed and enabled.

Place each of the skin folders you want to use in your plink subthemes skins folder. You will need to rename the MYTHEME_skinr_skin_plugin_info() {} function to your theme name. 

Eg: if you have a theme called sunny_days you will need to rename the function to  sunny_days_skinr_skin_plugin_info() {}
